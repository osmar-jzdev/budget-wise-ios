# Budget Application By Osmar Jz

## App Description [In progress]

The goal for the first MVP of this app has intend to be a basic personal finance app in which any person (primary young people) can track all their expenses and their incomes to understand how they manage their money focusing in the basics concepts of the personal finance.

The first version of this logo is simple, in order that any people feel related to the concept of save money, once they understand what are their expenses and incomes, and how can be related to see how much money they saved or not.

This Logo was took it from this web and you can se the credits of this here [Iconos8.es](https://iconos8.es/illustrations/illustration/flame-hands-drawing-a-dollar-sign-on-the-piggy-bank-and-putting-coins-in-it)

I decide make this application supporting only portrait oriented (at least for this first version) and developed for iOS because this app has to intend to be for any people around the world and any platform. I focus more in latest versions of iOS primary because this app has some UI built with SwiftUI, so to ensure the best experience I strong suggest install this app in devices with later versions of iOS 13.

## Dependencies

At this moment the project is built using some components of UIKit using a Storyboard structure and also implementing some views with SwiftUI, and Core Data for the local storage. So besides the basic libraries like Foundation and UIKit is also important to import Core Data and SwiftUI and at this moment is not necessary to use any other extra dependency or package which are not provided for XCode.

Note: consider to use Swift 5.1+ in order to use SwiftUI
